                                <p>Over the summer of 2013, I worked as a User Experience Design intern at <a href="http://www.viget.com/" target="_blank">Viget Labs</a> in Boulder, CO. Part of Viget's internship program required the interns in each of the company's three offices collaborate on a group project.</p>

                                <p>In the Boulder office, my intern group was made up of myself, a front-end development intern, and a back-end development intern. We chose to build a Rock Paper Scissors game. The project proved to be a very interesting UX design challenge as it was not a typical website.</p>

                                <h2>User Stories and User Flows</h2>
                                <div class="imageHolder">
                                    <img src="../images/battleofthehands/rpsUserflows.jpg" alt="user flows">
                                    <div class="subtitle">
                                        <p>Defining user stories and flows allowed us to walk through the process we aimed to create for our game.</p>
                                    </div>
                                </div>

                                <p>Our idea was to implement the game in phases, starting with the ability to play against a computer and then adding in the ability to play against other humans. We started by writing up User Stories to figure out what a user would be able to do with our app in each phase we would implement.</p>

                                <p>To figure out how a user would progress through a game, I began white-boarding user flow diagrams. I then transferred the diagrams into Omnigraffle and then worked to refine them by adding specific annotations and details about each step in the process.</p>

                                <h2 class="left">Wireframing</h2>

                                <div class="imageHolder">
                                    <img src="../images/rps/rps-wireframe1.jpg" alt="wireframes">
                                    <div class="subtitle">
                                        <p>Creating screenstates for each phase gave our team a blueprint to work from.</p>
                                    </div>
                                </div>

                                <p>Because of the five phase implementation plan for our project, I found it easiest to create small simplified wireframes for each screen state a user would encounter as they made their way through the game. By doing this, I was also able to list out all of the specific features that would be available within a screen. These became a good reference for both our front-end and back-end devs.</p>

                                <div class="imageHolder">
                                    <img src="../images/rps/rps-wireframe2.jpg" alt="wireframes">
                                    <div class="subtitle">
                                        <p>I created storyboards to convey the indended animations of action sequences.</p>
                                    </div>
                                </div>

                                <p>As we moved into the front-end development of the game, I created more detailed wireframes that featured my concepts for various animations. By showing these actions through wireframes, I was able tow work with Samii (FED) to create the animations featured in our game.</p>

                                <h2>Art Direction</h2>

                                <div class="imageHolder">
                                    <img src="../images/rps/rpsmockup.jpg" alt="Steve's Mockup">
                                    <div class="subtitle">
                                        <p>One of Steve Schoeffel's main mockups for the project.</p>
                                    </div>
                                </div>

                                <p>Our group, lacking a dedicated design intern, sought help from Viget designer Steve Schoeffel for the visual design of the project. We decided that we wanted to go for a flat cartoonish look and also wanted to include a bit of Boulder in the project (the Flatirons and Chautauqua Park). With our mood boards and after several conversations, Steve was able to create Photoshop comps that I then modified as needed to fit the different screen states necessary for front-end dev.</p>
